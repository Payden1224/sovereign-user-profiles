Sovereign User Profiles using Ceramic Self.ID

Welcome to the readme doc for Sovereign User Profiles using Ceramic Self.ID project! This project allows you to create and manage your own unique digital identity, based on the open-source Ceramic protocol.

What is Ceramic Self.ID?

Ceramic Self.ID is a decentralized identity protocol built on top of the Ceramic network. It allows individuals to create their own unique digital identity that they fully control and own, without relying on any centralized authority.

How does it work?

With Ceramic Self.ID, you create a digital identity that is unique to you and that you fully control. You can use this identity to authenticate yourself and interact with various decentralized applications and services that are built on top of the Ceramic network.

Your identity is stored on the Ceramic network in the form of a decentralized identifier (DID). This DID is a unique identifier that is owned and controlled by you, and it can be used to sign and verify messages and transactions.

What are Sovereign User Profiles?

Sovereign User Profiles are a specific implementation of Ceramic Self.ID that focuses on user profiles. With this implementation, you can create a digital profile that represents you and your identity. This profile can include various pieces of information, such as your name, email address, social media handles, and more.

Your Sovereign User Profile is fully customizable, meaning you can add or remove any information you want. You can also choose to make certain information public or private, depending on your preferences.

How to use Sovereign User Profiles?

To use Sovereign User Profiles, you first need to create your own Ceramic Self.ID. Once you have your Self.ID, you can create your own Sovereign User Profile by adding the relevant information and customizing it to your liking.

Once your Sovereign User Profile is created, you can use it to authenticate yourself and interact with various decentralized applications and services that are built on top of the Ceramic network. You can also choose to share your profile with others, or keep it private.

Conclusion

Sovereign User Profiles using Ceramic Self.ID is a powerful tool that allows you to create and manage your own unique digital identity. With this tool, you fully control your identity and can use it to authenticate yourself and interact with various decentralized applications and services. We hope you find this project useful and we welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have.
